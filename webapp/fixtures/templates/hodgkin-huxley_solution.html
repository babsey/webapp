<b>XOR-Example</b>.
(a) The layout of the network that implements an XOR-function.
(b) Appropriate inputs (500ms-1000ms: Poisson input to N1; 1000ms-1500ms: Poisson input to N2; 1500ms-2000ms:
    Poisson input to N1 and N2) are provided and the spiking activity of neuron N4 is measured.
(c) The histogram of neural activity reveals the XOR-function: the activity of ouput neuron N4 (blue line) is high only if one input neuron,
    N1 (orange line) or N2 (magenta line), is active and is zero otherwise.
