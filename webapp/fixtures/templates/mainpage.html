<h2 class='page-header'>Neural System Prediction and Identification Challenge</h2>

<b>nuSPIC</b> is designed to test two major assumptions in contemporary neuroscience:

<ul>
    <li>that we can extract the function(s) performed by a biological neural network provided complete knowledge of network structure and neural activity</li>
    <li>that we can build models of brain function based on the observed neural activity</li>
</ul>

"However, there is no clear evidence so far that these assumptions are in fact <em>valid</em>. Here we invite you to examine them using simple spiking neuron networks.

    <h2>The awards</h2>
    "We will award prizes to those users who successfully extract the 'hardwired' function each network was designed for. Additionally, we will consider solutions that propose functions performed by the networks  beyond those explicitly built-in. The awards will be given in a <b>first-solved-first-served</b> basis. Recommended steps:
    <ol>
        <li>'Play' around with the networks until you have come up with some reasonable hypothesis about the function that the network may be encoding.  </li>
        <li>Test your hypothesis for different inputs. Remember, a function should be valid for a broad range of inputs. </li>
        <li>Write down short comments about the logical steps that you are performing in the corresponding box. </li>
        <li>Once you are sure about the function that you have identified send us an email to <a href='mailto:sudo.nuspic@gmail.com'>sudo.nuspic@gmail.com</a> </li>
    </ol>
    "At the moment we have three open challenges: Cajal, Hebb and Marr. Each of these will be awarded a brand new <a  href='http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/features.html'>Apple iPod nano 8 GB</a>.
    "For those users who have come close enough to the solution, but are not quite there yet, we will hand out cool nuSPIC T-shirts.
